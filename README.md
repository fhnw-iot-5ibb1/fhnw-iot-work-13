### a) Parametric design, 15'
* Download OpenSCAD and create a simple 3D design.
* OpenSCAD is a domain specific language for CAD.
* Objects can built by subtracting simple shapes.
* Design a box that fits a Raspberry Pi Zero.
* Export as STL and slice it e.g. in Cura.
* Done? Take a look at this model.

### b) Second gen products, 15'
* Compare the Echo Dot (2nd gen) to the original Echo.
* What was changed, and what could be the rationale?
* If an injection mold is $10k, how much was saved?
* Which other parts could bring down the price?
* Be prepared to present your findings.
